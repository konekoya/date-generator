# dateGenerator
A simple date generator for my personal use

#TODO
1. use DOM fragment instend of appendChild in the loop.
2. user should be able to specify different month and generate it.
3. as motion above, we should then have an interface for that.
4. separate JavaScript from HTML and put them into main.js file.
